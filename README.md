# Hono + Preact Example

This project combines [Preact](https://preactjs.com) and [Hono](https://hono.dev).

- Hono forms the server layer, with server-side JSX as the templating system for your HTML output.
- Preact provides interactive application UX components.

## Why tho?

I wanted a very minimal web application server (Hono) that I could deploy almost anywhere without sacrificing real-time client side development.

This project uses Vite to build and serve both Hono and Preact from one repository, at the same time.

This is accomplished with a two-part configuration, one config for Hono, one for Preact.

Both builds are run simultaneously with `npm star` or `npm run dev`;

### Why Hono?

It's teeny and elegant, supports TypeScript out of the box, JSX for templating, and smells like rosemary.

### Why Preact?

Preact is everything good about React with far less bloat. Preact embraces modern browsers and native browser events. Preact is smaller, lighter, and faster than React.

Preact can be [configured](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/switching-to-preact/#setting-up-compat) to be 100% compatible with existing React libraries (if you need it).

Preact also has a nice [state management solution](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals), which React sorely lacks.

You could probably easily reconfigure this project to use Vite's React plugin (or Vue, or whatever) if that is more your cup of tea. üçµ

## Get started

After checking out the project, install dependencies with NPM (or your favorite package manager).

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or simply

```bash
npm start
```

The web application will be found at port 5000 [http://localhost:5000]()

The client side JavaScript HMR server will run on port 3000.

These values can be changed in `vite.config`
